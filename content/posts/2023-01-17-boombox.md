It's time to kick off the new year with another ISRU community challenge. This time, we will find inspiration through music by building a boombox for our workspaces.

Just three rules:
* Scavenge what you can and avoid spending money.
* It should add music to your studio or workshop.
* Keep your full boombox build secret until the 1st of April.
