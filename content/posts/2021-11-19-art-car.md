An art car is a vehicle that has had its appearance modified as an act of personal artistic expression. Art cars are often driven and owned by their creators, who are sometimes referred to as "Cartists". Many artists have created art cars, for example Alexander Calder, John Lennon, Jeff Koons, Janis Joplin, Tom Cramer, and Andy Warhol have all contributed to this form of art.

For our next community ISRU challenge, we want you to create an art car that expresses you! Scale and size doesnâ€™t matter, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, whatever you have access to is fine!
