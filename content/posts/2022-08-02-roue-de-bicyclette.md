Make your own genuine 'fake' of Marchel Duchamp's Roue de bicyclette using found and repurposed materials:

* You must find the parts for your sculpture, it cannot be something you currently own
* You cannot buy the parts, they must be found and you may not build parts from other items you already own
* You may remove parts from your found object to reach your completed sculpture
* The only parts you may add are a stool, a fork, and wheel
* Don't be too creative
