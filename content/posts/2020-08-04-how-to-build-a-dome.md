In remote collaboration with [@mitarchitecture](https://www.instagram.com/mitarchitecture/) and my studio team, you will build your own 3v geodesic dome from a material, and at a scale appropriate to your current environment — wherever and however you find yourself. Try to avoid buying things, make do with what you have.

In addition to building a Dome, you will create two communication materials:

* 1-Pager - Communicate what your dome is about. Must have Name, Date and a Title for Your Dome 8.5 x 11 sheet horizontal - folded in half - be mindful of the gutter
* 1-min Film - In that minute you need your name, the title of your dome, and to convey what’s important about it.

Note - This is not a class about Dome geometry, it’s about bricolage and construction. Don’t get lost in the math.
